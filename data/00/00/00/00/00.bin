  |   Die for Valhalla! is an action RPG where you hack, slash and crush    |
  |   your enemies! Possess and take full control of heroes, monsters and   |
  |   other things to help Vikings save their realm!                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You are a Valkyrie, from Old Norse valkyrja "chooser of the slain".   |
  |   You embark on a quest that will lead you through strange lands        |
  |   where Norse Mythology collides with Lovecraftian mythos. Sounds       |
  |   Weird? Well, because it is!                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You can play solo or with friends locally (up to 4 players).          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Two ways to enjoy the story:                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There are two story modes in the game: Beat 'Em Up and Rogue-lite.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Beat 'Em Up mode procedurally generates a larger world to explore   |
  |     with a more relaxed difficulty curve. You can revive your friends   |
  |     and the potions you find have useful or hilarious effects (or       |
  |     both)                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Rogue-lite mode generates a smaller world featuring steeper         |
  |     difficulty curve and permadeath. Some of the potions you find       |
  |     have malicious effects and you have to learn which ones to avoid    |
  |     in each run                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Randomized levels generated from hand-picked modules                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Action gameplay inspired by classic beat 'em ups                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * More than 10 Viking Clans to discover and unlock. Each Clan has a   |
  |     special bonus and access to different Viking Classes                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Each of the 7 Viking Classes comes with unique play styles and      |
  |     combos                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Over 80 skills to choose from when leveling up your Valkyrie        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Cute but bloodthirsty creatures will become your companions. Each   |
  |     has a different ability to aid you on your journey                  |
  |                                                                         |

  |     battle                                                              |
